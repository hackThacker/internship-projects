### VPN benefits and limitations


 ✅ Benefits of Using a VPN

- **Online Privacy**  
  VPNs hide your IP address, making it harder for websites, trackers, and hackers to trace your activity.

- **Security on Public Wi-Fi**  
  Protects your data when connected to unsecured public Wi-Fi networks (e.g., in cafes or airports).

- **Access Blocked Content**  
  Allows you to bypass geo-restrictions and censorship to access websites and streaming services.

- **Data Encryption**  
  Encrypts your internet traffic so that third parties (like ISPs or hackers) cannot read it.

- **Anonymity**  
  Helps you browse the internet more anonymously by masking your location and identity.

⚠️ Limitations of a VPN

- **Slower Internet Speeds**  
  VPNs can reduce connection speed due to data encryption and longer routing paths.

- **Not 100% Anonymous**  
  VPNs improve privacy but do not make you completely anonymous. VPN providers may still log data.

- **Blocked by Some Services**  
  Some websites and streaming platforms block VPN traffic.

- **Cost**  
  Good VPN services often require a paid subscription.

- **False Sense of Security**  
  A VPN protects your connection, but not your device. You still need antivirus and good security practices.


## Outcome

- Hands-on experience with VPNs and understanding of privacy tools.
