# Blazing-Fast Web Vulnerability Scanner

![Project Banner](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Complete-success) ![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.9+-blue)

A high-concurrency, asynchronous web application security scanner designed to rapidly identify critical vulnerabilities like XSS and SQLi. The tool features a real-time web UI and compiles findings into a professional, actionable intelligence dashboard.

---

## **Key Features**

-   üöÄ **Blazing-Fast Performance**: Built from the ground up with `aiohttp` and `asyncio` for a fully asynchronous workflow that drastically reduces scan times.
-   üåê **Intelligent Web Crawler**: Concurrently maps the entire target website, discovering all unique pages and their embedded forms to build a complete attack surface.
-   üéØ **Specialized Attack Modules**: High-speed, parallel scanners for **Reflected XSS** and **Error-Based SQLi** detection.
-   üìä **Professional Dashboard Reporting**: Presents findings not as a simple list, but as a dynamic threat intelligence dashboard with KPIs, charts, and detailed, interactive results.
-   üì° **Real-Time Scan Monitoring**: A Flask-based web interface streams live progress directly to the browser, providing a transparent view into the scanning process.
-   üß† **Smart Vulnerability De-duplication**: The engine reports each unique weakness only once, ensuring the final report is clean, concise, and actionable.

## **Project Setup & Installation Guide**

Follow these steps to get the scanner up and running on your local machine.

### **1. Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed:
*   [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or newer
*   `pip` (Python's package installer, typically included with Python)
*   [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/) (for cloning the repository)

### **2. Clone the Repository**

Open your terminal and clone the project repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/hackThacker/internship-projects.git && cd internship-projects/projects/"web vulnerability scanner"
```

### **3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

It is a best practice to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

```
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it (command differs by OS)

# On Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell)
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS / Linux (bash/zsh)
source venv/bin/activate
```
Your terminal prompt should now be prefixed with `(venv)`, indicating the environment is active.

### **4. Install Dependencies from `requirements.txt`**

All required libraries are specified in the `requirements.txt` file. Install them with a single command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **How to Run the Scanner**

With the setup complete, you are ready to launch the application.

1.  Ensure your terminal is in the project's root directory (`web vulnerability scanner`) and the virtual environment is active.

2.  Run the main Flask application:
    ```
    python app.py
    ```

3.  The server will start. Open your web browser and navigate to the local address provided:
    > **[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)**

4.  Input the full URL of a web application you are authorized to test 
(`http://testphp.vulnweb.com`) and click **Start Scan**.
